# React App to TAS

The goal of this project is to showcase a possible approach for deploying a React App on Tanzu Application Server (formerly Pivotal Cloud Foundry) addressing two major challenges:

1. Config management - especially when dealing with multiple environments
2. Enabling hash routes

The application uses NGINX buildpack and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A demo app can be found here: http://react-app-to-tas.cfapps.io (might be disabled later during the year)
